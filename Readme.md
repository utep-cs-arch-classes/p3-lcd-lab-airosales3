# arch1-project3-lcd: Floofy goat simulator

Hello fellow traveler! If you are here, then let me introduce to you a little fellow from a certain game called Deltarune.
His name is Ralsei, prince of the dark.  This little guy wandered off and ended up in some sort of tamagotchi simulator, but he doesn't mind at all.
You can make him fight, sing, defend, and you can pet the floofy boi (but don't give him doobie for goodness sake).

To load the floof, simply do a make all in the project folder
Then acess the code folder and do a make load
Oh, and you need a msp430 for this one too

That's all you have to do, have fun!
